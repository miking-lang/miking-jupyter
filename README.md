# Miking Jupyter

The goals of the Miking Jupyter project are to:

* Integrate Miking with the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
  environment by providing a Miking kernel for Jupyter.

* Provide seamless integration with Python from Miking languages,
  meaning that Miking functions can call Python code and the reverse.

* Support syntax highlighting and code editor customization for arbitrary DSLs designed in Miking.

* Support visualization within Jupyter notebooks.

## Jupyter Kernel

Currently, a simple Jupyter kernel extending the main IPython kernel is
available in [`mcore_kernel`](./mcore_kernel). It depends on the MCore REPL to
execute code from the user; presently, it simply feeds the cell contents into
the REPL and then displays the results.

### Dependencies and setup

To try out the kernel, you will need the following dependencies:

- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [IPython](https://ipython.org/).

  Installation using pip:
  `pip install ipython jupyter`

- The package [pexpect](https://pypi.org/project/pexpect/) is used to control
  the REPL process.

  Installation using pip:
  `pip install pexpect`

- The Miking bootstrap interpreter REPL. This should be available at the
  `develop` branch of the
  [main Miking repo](https://github.com/miking-lang/miking). Note that the
  bootstrap interpreter needs to be available in `PATH` under the name `miking`.

### Getting started

Make sure you have all dependencies installed, and that the MCore bootstrap
interpreter `miking` is in your `PATH`. Then, run the following command from the
project root directory to install the kernel.

```
jupyter kernelspec install mcore_kernel/
```

The kernel should now be known to Jupyter. To run it, **make sure you are in
the project root**, so that Python can locate the kernel module as
`mcore_kernel.kernel`. In the future, the kernel will be packaged so that Python
can find it from any directory.

You should now be able to run the kernel. For instance, to start a notebook,
run

```
jupyter notebook
```

and open a new notebook, selecting the `MCore` kernel. To test things out
quickly, check out the [`Example.ipynb`](./Example.ipynb) notebook.
